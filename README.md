## TODO
- Change the video and reference image resolution to 256x256 px, change videos to 30 frames per second. [ J ]
- Map the board from reference image to each video using key points (try onto the empty board and one with pieces on it). [ J ]
- Detect the dice and track its movement (might add calculating speed as a bonus). [ M ]
- Detect the pieces on the board.

## For later
- Map positions of each field on the board.
- Recognise the events (dice throw, movement of a piece).
- Detect status of the whole game, including the score.
